# Feeding Intolerance Management Module

This document describes the assessment and management of feeding intolerance during enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients.  
This module corresponds to **Part B** of the enteral nutrition workflow and is applied **only when feeding intolerance or gastrointestinal complications occur**.

This module is condition-triggered and may be applied at any stage after initiation of enteral nutrition.

---

## Scope and Purpose

- To identify and manage gastrointestinal intolerance during enteral nutrition
- To distinguish feeding-related intolerance from disease-related or drug-related causes
- To provide a structured approach for adjusting, withholding, or resuming enteral nutrition

Feeding intolerance management should always be integrated with ongoing reassessment of the primary enteral nutrition workflow.

## Definition of Feeding Intolerance

Feeding intolerance refers to the inability to continue or advance enteral nutrition due to gastrointestinal symptoms or complications, including but not limited to:

- Persistent abdominal pain
- Diarrhea
- Vomiting
- Abdominal distension
- Gastric retention
- Gastrointestinal bleeding

---

## General Principles

- Feeding intolerance should prompt **evaluation and adjustment**, not automatic discontinuation of enteral nutrition
- The underlying cause of intolerance should be identified whenever possible
- Enteral nutrition should be resumed or advanced once tolerance improves and contraindications are excluded

---

## B1. Persistent Abdominal Pain

### Assessment
- Evaluate severity and persistence of abdominal pain
- Perform physical examination
- Consider abdominal imaging (e.g., CT scan) if indicated

### Management
- Immediately discontinue enteral nutrition
- Evaluate for intestinal obstruction or intestinal ischemia

### Decision
- If intestinal obstruction or ischemia is confirmed:  
  - Enteral nutrition should remain discontinued
- If obstruction or ischemia is not confirmed:  
  - Consider resuming minimal enteral nutrition (trophic feeding)
  - Reassess gastrointestinal status frequently

---

## B2. Diarrhea

### B2.1 Etiological Assessment

Diarrhea should be evaluated to determine its most likely cause:

- Feeding-related
- Disease-related
- Drug-related

---

### B2.2 Initial Management of Suspected Feeding-Related Diarrhea

- Reduce enteral nutrition infusion rate
- Dilute enteral nutrition formula
- Use warmed enteral nutrition solution
- Continue enteral nutrition with close monitoring

Stool samples should be collected for **2–3 consecutive days**.

---

### B2.3 Stool Examination and Further Management

#### Stool Examination Results

- **No white blood cells (WBC) or red blood cells (RBC)**  
  - Continue observation for 2 days  
  - If diarrhea improves, continue enteral nutrition

- **Markedly increased WBC**  
  - Perform stool culture  
  - Test for *Clostridioides difficile*

- **Markedly increased RBC**  
  - Perform stool culture  
  - Test for *Clostridioides difficile*  
  - Consider colonoscopy if clinically indicated

---

## B3. Vomiting and Abdominal Distension

### Initial Management
- Elevate head of bed to 30–45 degrees
- Administer prokinetic agents

### Reassessment
- If symptoms improve:  
  - Continue enteral nutrition with monitoring
- If symptoms persist:  
  - Exclude intestinal obstruction or ischemia
  - Switch to post-pyloric feeding when appropriate

---

## B4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding

### Assessment
- Evaluate hemodynamic stability
- Assess severity and source of bleeding

### Management
- Temporarily discontinue enteral nutrition
- Initiate appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures

Resumption of enteral nutrition should be considered after bleeding is controlled and gastrointestinal function reassessed.

---

## B5. Clostridioides difficile Infection (CDI)

### Diagnosis
- Confirm diagnosis with stool testing

### Treatment Options
- Oral metronidazole: 200–500 mg every 6 hours or 500–750 mg every 8 hours
- Oral vancomycin: 125–500 mg every 6 hours

Enteral nutrition management should be individualized based on symptom severity and clinical response.

---

## Resumption of Enteral Nutrition

- Enteral nutrition may be resumed once feeding intolerance resolves or improves
- Restart with reduced infusion rate
- Advance progressively with close monitoring of tolerance

---

## Notes on Application

- Feeding intolerance management should be reassessed dynamically
- Enteral nutrition should not be permanently discontinued unless clear contraindications exist
- Decisions should be based on clinical assessment and reassessment rather than isolated symptoms
