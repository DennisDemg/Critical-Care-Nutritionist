# Acute Gastrointestinal Injury (AGI) Assessment Module

This document defines the assessment criteria and grading system for Acute Gastrointestinal Injury (AGI) in critically ill patients.  
The AGI assessment is used to support gastrointestinal function evaluation prior to and during enteral nutrition decision-making.

AGI grading should be performed before applying nutrition strategies that depend on gastrointestinal function.

---

## Purpose of AGI Assessment

- To evaluate the severity of gastrointestinal dysfunction in critically ill patients
- To guide the initiation, adjustment, or withholding of enteral nutrition
- To identify patients at risk of gastrointestinal failure or related complications

AGI grading reflects **functional gastrointestinal status**, not a specific disease diagnosis.

---

## Required Information for AGI Assessment

Before determining the AGI grade, the following clinical information should be collected whenever possible:

### 1. Vomiting or Gastric Reflux
- Presence of visible vomiting or gastric content reflux
- Quantity is not restricted; any visible reflux is considered relevant

---

### 2. Gastric Residual Volume
- Single gastric aspiration volume
- A volume greater than 200 ml is considered significant gastric retention

---

### 3. Diarrhea
- Frequency: ≥3 episodes per day  
- Or stool volume: >200–250 g/day (or >250 ml/day)

---

### 4. Abdominal Distension and Bowel Sounds
- Presence of abdominal distension
- Reduced or absent bowel sounds

---

### 5. Tolerance of Enteral Nutrition
- Inability to tolerate enteral nutrition due to vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other gastrointestinal causes
- Failure to achieve ≥20 kcal·kg⁻¹·day⁻¹ via enteral route within 72 hours

---

### 6. Intra-Abdominal Pressure (IAP)
- Measurement of intra-abdominal pressure if available
- IAP ≥12 mmHg measured at least twice within 6 hours  
- Or mean IAP ≥12 mmHg across at least four measurements

---

### 7. Gastrointestinal Complications
- Gastrointestinal paralysis or ileus
- Significant bowel dilation
- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Intestinal ischemia or necrosis
- Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS)

---

## AGI Grading Definitions

### AGI Grade I — Gastrointestinal Dysfunction

#### Key Features
- Nausea and/or vomiting on the first postoperative day
- Absence of bowel sounds after surgery
- Reduced intestinal motility during early shock phase

#### Interpretation
- Presence of gastrointestinal dysfunction
- No evidence of established gastrointestinal failure

---

### AGI Grade II — Gastrointestinal Dysfunction

#### Key Features
- Significant gastric retention or reflux
- Diarrhea
- Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH Grade I: IAP 12–15 mmHg)
- Vomitus containing blood clots
- Inability to tolerate ≥20 kcal·kg⁻¹·day⁻¹ via enteral nutrition within 72 hours

#### Interpretation
- Definite gastrointestinal dysfunction affecting nutrition tolerance

---

### AGI Grade III — Gastrointestinal Failure

#### Key Features
- Persistent gastric retention
- Progressive gastrointestinal paralysis
- Marked bowel dilation
- IAH Grade II (IAP 15–20 mmHg)
- Reduced abdominal perfusion pressure (≤60 mmHg)
- Gastrointestinal dysfunction contributing to persistent or worsening multiple organ dysfunction

#### Interpretation
- Established gastrointestinal failure

---

### AGI Grade IV — Gastrointestinal Failure with Remote Organ Dysfunction

#### Key Features
- Intestinal ischemia or necrosis
- Gastrointestinal bleeding leading to hemorrhagic shock
- Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction
- Abdominal compartment syndrome requiring decompressive intervention

#### Interpretation
- Severe gastrointestinal failure associated with distant organ dysfunction

---

## Terminology and Definitions

### Intra-Abdominal Hypertension (IAH)
- Defined as intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) ≥12 mmHg

---

### Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS)
- Sustained IAP ≥20 mmHg
- Associated with new onset organ dysfunction

---

### Feeding Intolerance (FI)
- Inability to achieve ≥20 kcal·kg⁻¹·day⁻¹ via enteral nutrition within 72 hours
- Caused by gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, or gastrointestinal bleeding
- Temporary interruption of enteral nutrition due to procedures is not considered FI

---

### Acute Gastrointestinal Injury (AGI)
- A functional classification describing the severity of gastrointestinal dysfunction in critically ill patients

---

## Notes on Application

- AGI grading should be reassessed dynamically as clinical conditions evolve
- If required information is unavailable, missing data should be obtained before assigning an AGI grade
- AGI grade should not be assumed and must be derived from clinical assessment
- AGI assessment should precede enteral nutrition decisions that depend on gastrointestinal function
