# Feeding Intolerance Assessment Module  
## Feeding Intolerance Score (FIS)

This document defines the **Feeding Intolerance Score (FIS)**, a quantitative bedside tool for assessing feeding intolerance in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition (EN).

The FIS is based on **gastrointestinal symptom severity**, rather than the mere presence or absence of symptoms, and is designed to guide **real-time EN adjustment decisions**.

---

## Purpose of the Feeding Intolerance Score

- To quantify the severity of feeding intolerance during enteral nutrition
- To standardize bedside assessment of gastrointestinal symptoms
- To guide decisions on continuation, adjustment, or suspension of enteral feeding
- To support protocolized enteral nutrition implementation

The FIS assesses **current feeding tolerance**, not nutrition risk or disease severity.

## Components of the FIS

The Feeding Intolerance Score consists of **three symptom domains**:

1. Abdominal distension or abdominal pain  
2. Nausea or vomiting (including gastric residual volume when applicable)  
3. Diarrhea  

Each domain is graded separately, and the **highest applicable grade** in each domain is used.

## Scoring System

### 1. Abdominal Distension / Abdominal Pain

| Clinical Finding | Points |
|------------------|--------|
| None | 0 |
| Mild abdominal distension, no abdominal pain | 1 |
| Moderate distension **OR** intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) 15–20 mmHg **OR** transient abdominal pain | 2 |
| Severe distension **OR** IAP > 20 mmHg **OR** persistent abdominal pain | 5 |

---

### 2. Nausea / Vomiting

| Clinical Finding | Points |
|------------------|--------|
| None | 0 |
| Nausea without vomiting | 1 |
| Nausea with vomiting not requiring decompression **OR** gastric residual volume (GRV) 250–<500 mL | 2 |
| Vomiting requiring gastric decompression **OR** GRV ≥ 500 mL | 5 |

---

### 3. Diarrhea

| Clinical Finding | Points |
|------------------|--------|
| None | 0 |
| Loose stools ≥ 3 times/day with volume 250–<500 mL | 1 |
| Loose stools ≥ 3 times/day with volume 500–<1500 mL | 2 |
| Loose stools ≥ 3 times/day with volume ≥ 1500 mL | 5 |

## Total FIS Calculation
Total FIS =
Abdominal distension/pain score + Nausea/vomiting score + Diarrhea score
