# Evidence-Based Enteral Nutrition Workflow (v1.1)

This document describes the evidence-based workflow for enteral and parenteral nutrition management in critically ill patients who cannot receive oral intake.  
Version 1.1 explicitly integrates structured assessment modules to ensure that nutrition decisions are made **only after required evaluations are completed**.

This workflow represents the **primary decision pathway** of the ICU nutrition knowledge base.

## Part A. Initiation and Advancement of Enteral Nutrition

### A0. Eligibility: Patients Unable to Receive Oral Intake

This workflow applies to critically ill patients who are unable to safely or adequately receive oral nutrition.  
Enteral nutrition (EN) is considered the preferred route of nutrition support whenever feasible.

---

### A1. Hemodynamic Stability Assessment

Before initiating enteral nutrition, hemodynamic stability must be confirmed.

#### Criteria for Hemodynamic Stability
- Mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg  
- Blood lactate < 4 mmol/L with a decreasing trend  
- Vasopressor dosage stable or decreasing  

#### Decision
- If criteria are met: proceed to gastrointestinal evaluation  
- If criteria are not met: delay enteral nutrition and reassess within 24 hours  

---

### A2. Gastrointestinal Evaluation

- Initial gastrointestinal evaluation should be completed within 24 hours after hemodynamic stabilization  
- Gastrointestinal function should be reassessed repeatedly during nutrition support  

The purpose of gastrointestinal evaluation is to assess the presence and severity of acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI).

**Assessment prerequisite:**  
If AGI grade is not explicitly available, required clinical information should be collected and structured AGI assessment should be performed prior to decision-making.

---

### A3. Initial Enteral Nutrition Strategy According to AGI Grade

AGI grading must be based on structured assessment and should not be assumed.

#### A3.1 Normal or Mild Gastrointestinal Injury (AGI I)

- Initial infusion rate: 25 ml/h  
- Formula type: standard polymeric formula  

---

#### A3.2 Moderate Gastrointestinal Injury (AGI II–III)

- Initial infusion rate: 10–15 ml/h  
- Formula type: semi-elemental or peptide-based formula  

---

#### A3.3 Severe Gastrointestinal Injury (AGI IV)

- Enteral nutrition should be withheld  

##### Nutrition Risk–Based Strategy
Nutrition risk classification should be based on a validated assessment (e.g., NUTRIC score).

- High nutrition risk: consider initiating parenteral nutrition (PN) within 3–5 days  
- Low nutrition risk: consider initiating PN after 7–10 days  

If nutrition risk classification is not available, structured nutrition risk assessment should be performed prior to decision-making.

---

### A4. Selection of Feeding Route Based on Aspiration Risk

Aspiration risk should be assessed based on clinical factors rather than a standardized scoring system.

- No significant aspiration risk: nasogastric feeding  
- Presence of aspiration risk: post-pyloric feeding is preferred  

---

### A5. Feeding Tolerance Evaluation

Feeding tolerance should be evaluated during active enteral nutrition.

- Assessment frequency: every 4–6 hours  
- Feeding Intolerance Score (FIS) is used for structured evaluation  

**Assessment prerequisite:**  
FIS should be calculated based on structured symptom assessment.  
FIS should not be estimated or assumed without sufficient clinical information.

#### Adjustment According to FIS
- FIS = 0: increase infusion rate by 10–25 ml/h  
- FIS = 1–2: maintain current infusion rate  
- FIS = 3–4: decrease infusion rate by 10 ml/h  
- FIS ≥ 5: suspend enteral nutrition  

---

### A6. Progressive Advancement and Target Setting

Daily evaluation of feeding tolerance is required.  
Enteral nutrition should be progressively advanced toward target intake when tolerated.

#### Target Intake
- Energy: 25–30 kcal·kg⁻¹·day⁻¹  
- Protein: 1.2–2.0 g·kg⁻¹·day⁻¹  

---

### A7. Coordination of Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition

#### A7.1 EN Reaches ≥60% of Target Within 7–10 Days

- Continue advancing enteral nutrition toward full target  
- Gradually reduce parenteral nutrition once EN reaches ≥60% of target  

---

#### A7.2 EN Does Not Reach ≥60% of Target Within 7–10 Days

- Initiate or supplement parenteral nutrition  
- Continue daily evaluation of enteral nutrition tolerance and advancement

## Notes on Use

- This workflow defines the primary sequence of nutrition decision-making  
- All assessment-based decisions require sufficient input data  
- If required assessment information is unavailable, further data collection should precede workflow progression  
- Structured assessment tools support, but do not replace, clinical judgment
