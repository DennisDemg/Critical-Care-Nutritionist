# Nutrition Risk Assessment Module (NUTRIC Score)

This document defines the **Nutrition Risk in the Critically Ill (NUTRIC) Score**, which is used to identify critically ill patients who are most likely to benefit from aggressive nutrition therapy.

The NUTRIC score is a validated, ICU-specific nutrition risk assessment tool and should be applied **early after ICU admission** to guide the timing and intensity of nutrition support.

---

## Purpose of Nutrition Risk Assessment

- To stratify critically ill patients according to nutrition-related risk
- To identify patients who are more likely to benefit from early and aggressive nutrition therapy
- To support decisions regarding enteral and parenteral nutrition initiation and escalation

The NUTRIC score assesses **risk**, not current nutritional status.

## Variables Required for NUTRIC Score Calculation

The NUTRIC score is calculated using **six variables**.  
IL-6 is optional and may be omitted if not routinely available.

### 1. Age

| Age (years) | Points |
|------------|--------|
| < 50 | 0 |
| 50 – < 75 | 1 |
| ≥ 75 | 2 |

---

### 2. APACHE II Score

| APACHE II | Points |
|----------|--------|
| < 15 | 0 |
| 15 – < 20 | 1 |
| 20 – 28 | 2 |
| > 28 | 3 |

---

### 3. SOFA Score

| SOFA | Points |
|------|--------|
| < 6 | 0 |
| 6 – < 10 | 1 |
| ≥ 10 | 2 |

---

### 4. Number of Comorbidities

| Comorbidities | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| 0 – 1 | 0 |
| ≥ 2 | 1 |

---

### 5. Days from Hospital Admission to ICU Admission

| Days | Points |
|------|--------|
| 0 – < 1 | 0 |
| ≥ 1 | 1 |

---

### 6. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Level (Optional)

| IL-6 (pg/mL) | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| < 400 | 0 |
| ≥ 400 | 1 |

> IL-6 may be excluded when not routinely available.  
> Excluding IL-6 has minimal impact on the predictive performance of the score.

## NUTRIC Score Calculation

The NUTRIC score is calculated as the **sum of all applicable points**.

Two scoring interpretations are used depending on IL-6 availability.

---

## Interpretation of NUTRIC Score

### If IL-6 Is Available

| Total Score | Risk Category | Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| 0 – 5 | Low Risk | Low nutrition-related risk |
| 6 – 10 | High Risk | Associated with worse clinical outcomes; most likely to benefit from aggressive nutrition therapy |

---

### If IL-6 Is Not Available (Modified NUTRIC)

| Total Score | Risk Category | Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| 0 – 4 | Low Risk | Low nutrition-related risk |
| 5 – 9 | High Risk | Associated with worse clinical outcomes; most likely to benefit from aggressive nutrition therapy |

---

## Clinical Implications

- **High NUTRIC score**:
  - Indicates high nutrition-related risk
  - Patients are more likely to benefit from early, adequate, and aggressive nutrition therapy
  - Delays or underfeeding may be associated with worse outcomes

- **Low NUTRIC score**:
  - Indicates lower nutrition-related risk
  - Aggressive early nutrition may provide limited benefit
  - Nutrition strategy can be more conservative and tolerance-driven

---

## Notes on Application

- NUTRIC score should be calculated early during ICU stay
- Recalculation may be considered if clinical status changes significantly
- NUTRIC score complements, but does not replace, gastrointestinal function assessment (e.g., AGI)
- Nutrition risk assessment should precede decisions regarding timing and intensity of nutrition support
