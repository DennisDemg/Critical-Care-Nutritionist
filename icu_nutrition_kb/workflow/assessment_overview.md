# Assessment Overview and Execution Order

This document defines the **assessment logic, execution order, and interaction principles** for structured nutrition-related assessments in critically ill patients.

It serves as a **coordination layer** between the primary enteral nutrition workflow and individual assessment modules, ensuring that assessments are performed **only when appropriate**, **in the correct sequence**, and **with sufficient input data**.

This document does not introduce new scoring systems.  
It specifies **when and how existing assessment modules should be applied**.

---

## Purpose of This Overview

- To clarify the relationship between different assessment modules
- To prevent premature or inappropriate use of scoring systems
- To standardize the order of assessments during nutrition decision-making
- To guide information collection before entering decision-dependent workflow steps

---

## Assessment Modules Included

The ICU nutrition knowledge base currently includes the following assessment modules:

1. Acute Gastrointestinal Injury (AGI) Assessment  
2. Feeding Intolerance Score (FIS)  
3. Nutrition Risk Assessment (NUTRIC Score)

Each module serves a **distinct clinical purpose** and should not be used interchangeably.

---

## Conceptual Distinction Between Assessments

### 1. AGI Assessment
- Evaluates **gastrointestinal organ function**
- Describes the **severity of gastrointestinal dysfunction**
- Determines whether enteral nutrition is feasible and at what initial intensity

AGI assessment answers the question:  
**“Is the gastrointestinal tract functionally capable of receiving enteral nutrition?”**

---

### 2. Feeding Intolerance Score (FIS)
- Quantifies **current tolerance to ongoing enteral nutrition**
- Reflects the **severity of gastrointestinal symptoms during feeding**
- Guides real-time adjustment, reduction, or suspension of enteral nutrition

FIS answers the question:  
**“How well is the patient tolerating enteral nutrition right now?”**

---

### 3. Nutrition Risk Assessment (NUTRIC)
- Estimates **nutrition-related risk and potential benefit from nutrition therapy**
- Does not assess gastrointestinal function or tolerance
- Guides timing and aggressiveness of nutrition support

NUTRIC answers the question:  
**“How much is this patient likely to benefit from adequate and early nutrition therapy?”**

---

## Required Execution Order

Assessments should be applied in the following **logical sequence**, depending on clinical context.

---

### Step 1. Nutrition Risk Assessment (NUTRIC)

**When to apply:**
- Early after ICU admission
- Prior to deciding on the urgency and intensity of nutrition support

**Prerequisite information:**
- Age
- Disease severity scores (APACHE II, SOFA)
- Comorbidities
- Time from hospital admission to ICU admission
- IL-6 (if available)

**Output:**
- High nutrition risk or low nutrition risk classification

---

### Step 2. Gastrointestinal Function Assessment (AGI)

**When to apply:**
- Before initiating enteral nutrition
- Before advancing enteral nutrition intensity
- When gastrointestinal function is uncertain

**Prerequisite information:**
- Symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension
- Gastric residuals (if assessed)
- Intra-abdominal pressure (if available)
- Presence of gastrointestinal complications

**Output:**
- AGI grade (I–IV)

---

### Step 3. Feeding Tolerance Assessment (FIS)

**When to apply:**
- Only after enteral nutrition has been initiated
- During active enteral feeding
- When gastrointestinal symptoms develop during feeding

**Prerequisite information:**
- Abdominal distension or pain severity
- Nausea or vomiting
- Diarrhea frequency and volume
- Relevant measurements (e.g., GRV, IAP if applicable)

**Output:**
- Total FIS score (0–15)
- Classification of feeding tolerance severity

---

## Conditional Application Rules

### AGI and FIS Are Not Interchangeable

- AGI should **not** be inferred from FIS
- FIS should **not** be used to assign AGI grade
- AGI reflects baseline gastrointestinal function
- FIS reflects dynamic feeding tolerance

---

### Nutrition Risk Does Not Override Gastrointestinal Contraindications

- A high NUTRIC score does not justify enteral nutrition if AGI IV is present
- Gastrointestinal feasibility must be confirmed before acting on nutrition risk

---

### Feeding Intolerance Does Not Automatically Imply Gastrointestinal Failure

- A high FIS score indicates intolerance severity
- Further evaluation is required to determine underlying cause
- Temporary feeding suspension does not equal permanent contraindication

---

## Information Sufficiency Principle

Before applying any assessment module:

- If required input data are missing, they should be obtained first
- Scores should not be estimated or assumed
- When data cannot be obtained, clinical reassessment should be prioritized over scoring

---

## Integration With the Primary Workflow

- NUTRIC informs **urgency and intensity** of nutrition support
- AGI determines **feasibility and initial strategy** of enteral nutrition
- FIS guides **ongoing adjustment and safety monitoring** during enteral feeding

All assessment outputs should be interpreted **within the context of the primary enteral nutrition workflow**.

---

## Notes on Clinical Use

- Assessments should be repeated when clinical conditions change significantly
- Scoring systems support, but do not replace, clinical judgment
- Structured assessments are intended to improve consistency, not restrict individualized care
